# TankAR
#### *A game made for the forfillment of the Argumented Reality part of coursework for my AR and VR Module*
###### Keywords; AR, App Development, Unity Game Engine and XR Foundation

In this project, I have made a Historical AR game that allows the user to spawn objects which are World War 2 tanks using an Interface with some basic UI using assets produced by Red Crystal(store page for the content used: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/10-low-poly-tanks-107329) and royalty free tank sounds, which in most , correspond to the tank that is placed.

## Key functionality of the project;
- A functional , menu for spawning, deleting and picking the tank wanting to be spawned
- Uses the camera to produce a virtual plane that allows the tanks to spawn
- Fully interactable models that can be placed and played around with
- usage of the XR foundation to produce an argumented experience 


## Areas for Improvement
Although the project works well for the functionality provided, There are a few glitches and bugs in the project as well as better design choices to made when improving the project.
- Sometimes tanks spawn through the menu, even though some code is there to prevent that from happening , so more work must be done to spawning of tanks when interacting with the menu.
- Sometimes the interactables do not allow for certain actions like moving, and its very glitchy on off ability 
- The UI could be more user friendly as well as provide a tutorial on how to operate the experience.
- I would like to add a feature that, instead of having to press a button to start deleting, holding down an object long enough to give a menu of functions that can be executed on that specific object.
- UI providing more functionality
- Potential ability to place two tanks against each other??

- ONE OF THE MAIN PRIORITIES IS TO CLEAN UP THE FILES, OMG KACPER WHY DID YOU NOT SORT THE FILES OUT INTO FOLDERS AND MADE SENSIBLE SCENE NAMES AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
